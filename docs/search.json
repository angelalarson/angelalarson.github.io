    "text": "Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has become an increasingly essential area of research in the effort to limit global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial temperature levels–a goal set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a marine CDR method that aims to capture carbon dioxide (CO[2]) by adding alkali to the surface ocean. Alkalinity addition converts aqueous CO[2] to stable bicarbonate and carbonate ions, causing a surface-ocean CO[2] deficit to be equilibrated by the in-gassing of atmospheric CO[2]. OAE shows significant potential for carbon removal, yet critical knowledge gaps persist in understanding the response of marine organisms to the rapid pH increase from alkalinity addition. In a study, we conducted a laboratory mesocosm experiment investigating the impacts of OAE on calcification in Emiliania huxleyi, a calcareous marine phytoplankton, using a method that mimics brucite dissolution (brucite-inspired alkalinity addition). The experiment was conducted for nine days with four sampling points, and each carboy was bubbled with 420 ppm CO[2] to simulate ocean-atmosphere gas exchange. The treatments with alkalinity addition of ~700 umol kg-1 resulted in a total alkalinity concentration of ~2900 umol kg-1. Our results aim to quantify the effects of the brucite treatment on coccolithophore growth and calcification, driving future research on OAE in marine ecosystems.\n[provide code]"

    "text": "Rugby\nI started playing rugby in my first year at UC Santa Barbara, finding an immediate home on the team and a passion for this amazing sport. When I tore my ACL shortly after joining, I committed myself to strength training and the return-to-play process. In my time off, I began specializing in specific skills such as kicking and quickly earned a starting position on the team once I returned to playing. Two years after my injury, I was selected to represent my division playing for the Pacific South Griffins, a team composed of the top collegiate women’s rugby players in Southern California and Arizona. I played in the U23 All Stars tournament in Boston, MA in June 2024, where we placed second in our tier. As I finish up my time playing rugby at UC Santa Barbara, I intend to take up coaching to continue contributing to this amazing community."

    "text": "Outdoor Education\nIn my formative years, I attended Two Sentinels Girl Scout Camp, an outdoor backpacking camp in the Sierra Nevada. Prior to my first year at UC Santa Barbara, I became a camp counselor at Two Sentinels for the first time, sparking my love for outdoor education. Influenced by my experiences, I enrolled in a six month outdoor leadership training course my first year at UC Santa Barbara where I was exposed to a variety of outdoor activities and education. This has ultimately lead to my passion for fieldwork and providing equal opportunities for outdoor education. In many ways, I study earth and environmental sciences because of my outdoor education influences, providing me with an outlet to turn my hobbies and passions into a career."
