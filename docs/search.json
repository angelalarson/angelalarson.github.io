Maps were overlain with local Dibblee maps using QGIS and Inkscape for visual editing. Strike and dip measurements were taken using both a Brunton compass and Clino app for IPhone. A hand lens and geologic field notebook was used for mineral identification and grain size determination. Figures and images developed in Inkscape were adapted from in situ measurements.\nInterested in reading my Santa Barbara Field Guide? Check out the full project here\n\nStrike and Dip Mapping\nBelow is a map of all strike and dip measurements I took for the three mapping projects measured using the Clino app. Specifically, the Ellwood Beach and Camino Cielo Rd mapping measurements are featured in the Santa Barbara Field Guide linked above. Colors are determined by the sedimentary rock formation name for these regions.\nThe EARTH 104A course included a four day field trip to the Mojave Desert, where we completed a handwritten mapping project. These measurements were not included in the Santa Barbara Field Guide. Colors are grouped by rock type for this region."

    "text": "Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has become an increasingly essential area of research in the effort to limit global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial temperature levels–a goal set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) is a marine CDR method that aims to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) by adding alkaline solutions to the surface ocean. Alkalinity additions convert aqueous CO2 to stable bicarbonate and carbonate ions, causing a surface-ocean CO2 deficit to be equilibrated by the in-gassing of atmospheric CO2. OAE shows significant potential for carbon removal, yet critical knowledge gaps persist in understanding the response of marine organisms to the rapid shift in alkalinity and pH from added alkalinity. In a study, we conducted a laboratory mesocosm experiment investigating the impacts of a brucite-inspired alkalinity addition (BIAA) for OAE on the growth and calcification in Emiliania huxleyi, a calcareous marine phytoplankton. The treatment used MgCl2 * 6H2O and NaOH to raise alkalinity by ~690 umol kg-1, resulting in a total alkalinity of ~2900 umol kg-1. Our results suggest BIAA enhanced the growth rates of E. huxleyi, suggesting a possible stimulatory effect of increased magnesium concentrations within seawater. Calcification rates, measured as cellular particulate inorganic carbon (PIC), remained stable across treatments; however, the PIC:POC (particulate organic carbon) ratio was significantly higher in BIAA. This is likely a result of reduced POC production within BIAA compared to the Control. Furthermore, the presence of an orange precipitate coincided with the removal of dissolved inorganic phosphate indicates potential nutrient removal in our carboys. Our results further our understanding of the alkaline-specific impacts of a magnesium-rich alkalinity addition on the biogeochemical and physiological processes of E. huxleyi."

When I tore my ACL shortly after joining, I committed myself to strength training and the return-to-play process. In my time off, I began specializing in specific skills such as kicking and quickly earned a starting position on the team once I returned to playing. Two years after my injury, I was selected to represent my division playing for the Pacific South Griffins, a team composed of the top collegiate women’s rugby players in Southern California and Arizona. I played in the U23 All Stars tournament in Boston, MA in June 2024, where we placed second in our tier.
