Maps were overlain with local Dibblee maps using QGIS and Inkscape for visual editing. Strike and dip measurements were taken using both a Brunton compass and Clino app for IPhone. A hand lens and geologic field notebook was used for mineral identification and grain size determination. Figures and images developed in Inkscape were adapted from in situ measurements.\nLink to field guide\n[insert images]"

    "text": "Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has become an increasingly essential area of research in the effort to limit global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial temperature levels–a goal set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a marine CDR method that aims to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) by adding alkali to the surface ocean. Alkalinity addition converts aqueous CO2 to stable bicarbonate and carbonate ions, causing a surface-ocean CO2 deficit to be equilibrated by the in-gassing of atmospheric CO2. OAE shows significant potential for carbon removal, yet critical knowledge gaps persist in understanding the response of marine organisms to the rapid pH increase from alkalinity addition. In a study, we conducted a laboratory mesocosm experiment investigating the impacts of OAE on calcification in Emiliania huxleyi, a calcareous marine phytoplankton, using a method that mimics brucite dissolution (brucite-inspired alkalinity addition). The experiment was conducted for nine days with four sampling points, and each carboy was bubbled with 420 ppm CO2 to simulate ocean-atmosphere gas exchange. The treatments with alkalinity addition of ~700 umol kg-1 resulted in a total alkalinity concentration of ~2900 umol kg-1. Our results aim to quantify the effects of the brucite treatment on coccolithophore growth and calcification, driving future research on OAE in marine ecosystems."

When I tore my ACL shortly after joining, I committed myself to strength training and the return-to-play process. In my time off, I began specializing in specific skills such as kicking and quickly earned a starting position on the team once I returned to playing. Two years after my injury, I was selected to represent my division playing for the Pacific South Griffins, a team composed of the top collegiate women’s rugby players in Southern California and Arizona. I played in the U23 All Stars tournament in Boston, MA in June 2024, where we placed second in our tier. As I finish up my time playing rugby at UC Santa Barbara, I intend to take up coaching to continue contributing to this amazing community."

Prior to my first year at UC Santa Barbara, I became a camp counselor at Two Sentinels for the first time, sparking my love for outdoor education. Influenced by my experiences, I enrolled in a six month outdoor leadership training course my first year at UC Santa Barbara where I was exposed to a variety of outdoor activities and education. This has ultimately lead to my passion for fieldwork and providing equal opportunities for outdoor education. In many ways, I study earth and environmental sciences because of my outdoor education influences, providing me with an outlet to turn my hobbies and passions into a career."
